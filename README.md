## Usage

- The user is presented with a homepage where they have the option to click on log-in OR sign-up. They are then sent to the page to log-in OR sign-up.
- After they enter their information properly, the user is sent to the member's page where they have access to the activies going on in their area.
- They are given the option to add an activity of "FUN" or "SERIOUS" which will populate our database.
- They can also pick from a dropdown list that will present all existing activities pulled from our database. If they click on an activity, the full description will appear in the dedicated section below.
- Finally, they are able to view a history of the activities they posted on the bottom of the member's page.
- When they are done, they can LOGOUT.
